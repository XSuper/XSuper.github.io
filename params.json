  "body": "# Hydejack\r\n\r\nHydejack is a pretentious two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme, stolen by [`@qwtel`](https://twitter.com/qwtel) from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com). You could say it was.. [hydejacked](http://media3.giphy.com/media/makedRIckZBW8/giphy.gif).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nUnlike Hyde, it's opinionated about how you are going to use it (as a blog!)\r\nFeatures included are:\r\n\r\n* Touch-enabled sidebar / drawer for mobile, including fallback when JS is disabled.\r\n* Github Pages compatible tag support based on [this post][tag].\r\n* Customizable link color and sidebar image, per-site, per-tag and per-post.\r\n* Optional author section at the bottom of each post.\r\n* Posts grouped by year on front and tag page.\r\n* Social media icons (github, twitter) on sidebar.\r\n* Optional comment section powered by Disqus.\r\n* Math blocks via [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nHydejack is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack) for downloads, bug reports, and feature requests.\r\n\r\n## Sidebar\r\nI love the original Hyde theme, but unfortunately the layout isn't as great on small screens.\r\nSince the sidebar moves to the top, the user has to scroll just to read the title of a blog post.\r\n\r\nBy using a drawer component I was able to retain the original two column layout. It's possible to move the drawer via touch input (with the help of a little JavaScript).\r\n\r\nSince the background image contributes to the feel of the page I'm letting it peek over the edge a bit. This also provides a hint to the user that an interaction is possible.\r\n\r\n## Manual\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nYou can configure important aspects of the theme via [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/master/_config.yml). This includes:\r\n\r\n* the blog description in the sidebar\r\n* the (optional) author description and photo\r\n* default image and link color of the blog\r\n* the github and twitter usernames\r\n\r\n### How to Change the Image and Color of a Post\r\nIn the manifest of a blog post, simply add an url as `image` and a CSS color as `color`:\r\n\r\n~~~yml\r\nlayout: post\r\ntitle: Introducing Hydejack\r\nimage: http://qwtel.com/hydejack/public/img/hyde.jpg\r\ncolor: '#949667'\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n### How to Add a New Tag\r\n\r\nTags are not meant to be used #instagram #style: #food #goodfood #happy #happylife #didimentionfood #yougetthepoint, as each tag requires some setup work. I tend to think of it as categories that can be combined.\r\n\r\n1.  Add an entry to `_data/tags.yml`, where the key represents a slug and provide at least a `name` value and optionally `image`, `color` and `description`.\r\n\r\n    Example `/_data/tags.yml`:\r\n\r\n    ~~~yml\r\n    mytag:\r\n      name: My Tag\r\n    ~~~\r\n\r\n2.  Make a new file in the `tag` folder, using the same name you've used as the key / slug and change the `tag` and `permalink` entries.\r\n\r\n    Example `/tag/mytag.md`:\r\n\r\n    ~~~yml\r\n    layout: blog_by_tag\r\n    tag: mytag\r\n    permalink: /tag/mytag/\r\n    ~~~\r\n\r\n3.  Tag your blog posts using the `tags` key (color and image will only depend on the first tag).\r\n\r\n    ~~~yml\r\n    layout: post\r\n    title: Introducing My New Tag\r\n    tags: [mytag, othertag]\r\n    ~~~\r\n\r\n4. (optional) Add the tag to the sidebar, by adding it to `sidebar_tags` in `_config.yml`.\r\n   They will appear in the listed order.\r\n\r\n   ~~~yml\r\n   sidebar_tags: [mytag, othertag]\r\n   ~~~\r\n\r\n[tag]: http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/\r\n",
